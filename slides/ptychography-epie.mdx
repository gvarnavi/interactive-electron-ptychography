## Electron Ptychography

- The 4D-STEM phase problem can be solved using proximal gradient algorithms:
  - "Fourier" projection
    - Reconstructed probe and object accurately reproduce measured intensities
  - "Overlap" projection
    - Reconstructed probe and object are self-consistent with adjacent scanning positions
